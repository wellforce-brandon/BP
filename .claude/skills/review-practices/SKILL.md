You are reviewing the BP best practices knowledge base at `C:\Github\BP` for quality, consistency, and completeness.

This skill has two phases: internal review (existing entries) and external discovery (new entries from the web). Run both unless the user specifies one.

---

## Phase 1: Internal Review

### Step 1: Load all entries

1. Read `C:\Github\BP\llms.txt` to get all concern categories and entry counts
2. For each concern, read its `llms.txt` index
3. Read every entry file listed in those indexes

### Step 2: Check each entry for quality

For each entry, verify:

- **Format compliance** -- Has all required sections: frontmatter (concern, tech, priority, source-repo, applies-to), PATTERN, WHY, EXAMPLE, CHECK, IMPLEMENT
- **Frontmatter accuracy** -- Does the `concern` field match the directory it's in? Are `tech` and `applies-to` tags reasonable?
- **CHECK is testable** -- Each CHECK item should be mechanically verifiable (file exists, config contains X, etc.), not subjective
- **IMPLEMENT is actionable** -- Steps should be concrete and ordered, not vague
- **EXAMPLE has file paths** -- Examples should reference source file locations
- **Priority is justified** -- FOUNDATIONAL should truly be universal; RECOMMENDED should have clear tech-tag scope

### Step 3: Check for conflicts

- **Between BP entries** -- Do any two entries give contradictory advice? (e.g., one says use ESLint, another says use Biome)
- **Between BP and LL-G** -- Read `C:\Github\LL-G\llms.txt` and check for entries that contradict BP recommendations
- **Stale source repos** -- For each entry's `source-repo`, verify the pattern still exists there (quick check, not exhaustive)

### Step 4: Check index integrity

- **Entry counts match** -- Does the master `llms.txt` entry count for each concern match the actual number of bullets in that concern's `llms.txt`?
- **All files linked** -- Does every `.md` file in a concern directory have a corresponding bullet in its `llms.txt`?
- **No broken links** -- Do all relative links in `llms.txt` files resolve to existing files?
- **No orphaned files** -- Are there entry files not listed in any index?

### Step 5: Report internal findings

Output a structured report:

```
## Internal Review Results

### Quality Issues
- <entry slug>: <issue description>

### Conflicts Found
- <entry A> vs <entry B>: <what conflicts>

### Index Issues
- <concern>: count says N but has M entries
- <file>: not linked in any index

### Stale Entries
- <entry slug>: source pattern no longer exists in <source-repo>
```

Fix any index issues (count mismatches, missing links) automatically. Flag quality issues and conflicts for user review.

## Phase 2: External Discovery

### Step 1: Search for current best practices

Run parallel web searches for:

1. `"Claude Code" best practices 2026` -- Claude Code-specific patterns
2. `"CLAUDE.md" configuration best practices` -- CLAUDE.md structuring
3. `monorepo best practices 2026 pnpm turborepo` -- monorepo patterns
4. `typescript project configuration best practices 2026` -- TS tooling
5. `docker node.js production best practices 2026` -- deployment patterns
6. `design tokens OKLCH best practices 2026` -- design system patterns
7. `vitest playwright testing best practices 2026` -- testing patterns

### Step 2: Filter and compare

For each search result:
1. Read the page content (use WebFetch on the top 2-3 results per search)
2. Extract concrete, actionable practices (not generic advice)
3. Compare against existing BP entries -- skip anything already covered
4. Compare against the repo inventory -- skip patterns for tech stacks none of the repos use

### Step 3: Draft new entries

For each novel practice found, create a draft entry:

1. Write the entry file to `C:\Github\BP\practices\<concern>\<slug>.md`
2. Add `discovered-by: web-review` to the frontmatter
3. In the NOTES section, include the source URL and date discovered
4. Update the concern's `llms.txt` index
5. Update the master `llms.txt` entry count

### Step 4: Report discoveries

```
## External Discovery Results

### New Entries Created
- <concern>/<slug>: <title> (source: <url>)

### Considered but Skipped
- <topic>: Already covered by <existing-entry>
- <topic>: Not applicable to any repo in inventory

### Existing Entries Worth Updating
- <entry slug>: <what changed in the ecosystem since this was written>
```

## Phase 3: Summary

Output a final summary:

```
## BP Review Complete

Internal:
  - Entries reviewed: N
  - Quality issues: N (N auto-fixed, N need review)
  - Conflicts found: N
  - Index fixes applied: N

External:
  - Sources searched: N
  - New entries created: N
  - Updates suggested: N

Total entries: N (was M before review)
```
