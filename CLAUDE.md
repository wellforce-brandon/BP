# BP: Best Practices Knowledge Base

This repo is a machine-readable knowledge base of proven coding patterns and best practices. It is the complement to LL-G (Lessons Learned & Gotchas): where LL-G tracks what NOT to do, BP tracks what TO do.

## How to Use This KB (RULE 3 Protocol)

**Before starting new work or onboarding a repo:**
1. Read `llms.txt` in this repo root -- it lists all concerns and links to their indexes
2. Load the `llms.txt` for each concern relevant to your current task
3. Load individual entry files marked FOUNDATIONAL, or any entry whose title matches the specific task

Do not load every entry. Use the two-level index to load only what is relevant.

## Entry File Format

Each entry file uses this structure:

```
---
concern: <concern-category>
tech: [tech1, tech2]
priority: foundational|recommended|optional
source-repo: <repo-name>
applies-to: [tech1, tech2]
---
# Entry Title

## PATTERN
What the proven pattern looks like and how it works.

## WHY
Why this is better than alternatives. What problems it prevents.

## EXAMPLE
Code or config from the source repo (with file paths).

## CHECK
How to verify if a repo already follows this:
- [ ] Check condition 1
- [ ] Check condition 2

## IMPLEMENT
Steps to adopt this in a repo that doesn't have it:
1. Step one
2. Step two

## NOTES
Edge cases, caveats, related practices.
```

## Priority Legend

- **FOUNDATIONAL** -- universal patterns that every repo should follow. Always load these.
- **RECOMMENDED** -- strong patterns for repos with matching tech tags. Load when relevant.
- **OPTIONAL** -- nice-to-have patterns. Skip unless explicitly asked.

## Adding a New Practice

Run `/add-practice` from any repo session. The skill collects the details and writes the entry file, updates the concern `llms.txt`, and updates the master `llms.txt` entry count atomically.

To add manually:
1. Create `practices/<concern>/<slug>.md` using the entry format above
2. Append a bullet to `practices/<concern>/llms.txt` under `## Entries`
3. Increment the entry count in the master `llms.txt` for that concern

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/add-practice` | Manually add a new best practice entry |
| `/audit-repo` | Audit a repo against applicable practices, save checklist to target repo |
| `/apply-practice <slug>` | Apply a single practice to a target repo |
| `/fix-audit` | Apply all failing practices from the most recent audit |
| `/review-practices` | Review all entries for quality/conflicts, search web for new practices |

## Practice Scout (Auto-Discovery)

A global Stop hook fires at the end of every Claude Code session. The practice-scout agent (Haiku) checks if any commits were made during the session, analyzes their diffs, checks BP for existing coverage, and auto-creates entries for novel reusable patterns. Most sessions produce nothing -- only infrastructure, tooling, and configuration patterns are captured.

Entries created by the scout include "Auto-discovered by practice-scout" in NOTES with the source repo and commit hash.

## KB Location

This repo lives at `C:\Github\BP`. All paths in `llms.txt` and per-concern indexes are relative to the repo root.
